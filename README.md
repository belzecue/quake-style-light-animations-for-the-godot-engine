https://github.com/id-Software/Quake

Godot version 3.4.2

Features:
 - Includes all the 11 original Quake animation tables.
 - The light animation affects the emission of the lamp material/s.
 - Supports optional fade between the string animation values to break the stepping effect where needed.
 - Supports custom user animations.
 - Animations can be previewed in the Godot editor.

Feel free to use anyway you like. Credits appreciated.
